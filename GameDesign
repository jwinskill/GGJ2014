Volcano
- Comes from Mantle
- Causes drop in mantle temperature
- Increase in crust temperature

Steam Vent
- Each adds a quarter water (if there is atmosphere)
- Comes from Crust
- Causes drop in crust temperature

Different Cores Get Different Temps From Heat Gun
Core adds heat to all the layers at a much higher rate(decreases stability faster)
Mantle adds heat to crust as well
Crust adds heat to the planet slowest, but only affects itself

Features:
Atmosphere Opacity (scale it up as it grows?)
Can't pour heat into atmosphere
Lighting indicates heat of each layer
Blow up planet if temp / stability go too far?
Temperature drops slowly without atmosphere

Project Setup

Water = 4 steam vents
Atmosphere = 3 volcanoes
Temperature = All four layers added/averaged/ weighted?
Stability is the health of the planet (0 blows it up)
